function outM = oneSweep(inM)
% One step of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life.
% inM and outM are 0-1 matrices of the same size. 1 is live; 0 is dead.
% inM is the initial state; outM is the state after 1 step of the game.
% Every "cell" in the matrix interacts with its immediate neighbors, which
% are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
% At this time step, the following transitions occur:
% A live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies (under-population).
% A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives on.
% A live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies (overcrowding).
% A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes live (reproduction).
